            The app provide events tracking and fertile windows prediction for users. Also it allows medical documents
            upload and a few medical 'journeys'.
          outcome: |
            I designed the API as the hub for serving the content to the mobile app. The medications list can get updated
            remotely.

            The mobile app can function normally in offline mode and the user generated content will be synced with server
            once then regain network connection.

            The mobile app has subscription payment scheme where the user pay for monthly or annually.
            The project hasn't been released yet.

            The app provide customer's requests portal, estimates & proposal generation. The mobile app also
            provide field worker's offline access to the assigned job.

            The request form was built in Vuejs, the form then get embedded in the client's existing WordPress site
            as an iframe.

            The admin site was also built in Vuejs as front end and the back end was built with ASP .NET
            In this development phase, we're to build a mobile app for field agents.
          outcome:
            The mobile app was built with Ionic and Reactjs which will sync all assigned jobs to the device
            to provide offline access to field agents. Any data the agents input during offline mode will be kept
            and sync back to the server when they have a connection again.

            The project was released and available internally.

            The client was a door manufacturer company.

            The app provide a management web for back office workers to record customer's requests and generate quotes.

            The requests consist of configuration for doors, which will be approved by the head architect before moving
            to the factory floor for production.
          outcome: |
            We built the website in Angularjs, it keeps an open SignalR connection with the backend to update door's 
            production status in real time.

            The back end was built in ASP .Net.

            with necessary skills to excel in the modern world.
          outcome: |
            We implemented the lesson presentation and quizzes in Vuejs, as an experimental move toward adopting a new technology.
            The result wasn't so bad. It performs just as well as Reactjs.

            We used OpenCV for image detection for automatic paper grading. The teachers/facilitators only have to scan the exam
            papers with their phone, then the server will queue them for processing with Python.

            We designed the server to handle video and images transformation, but was later scraped since the client wants
            to cut cost. In the end, we let them use unlisted YouTube videos and put raw images on their web server.
            The product was released locally in Vietnam.

            It also provide a place for the customers to request inspection services.

            The mobile app provide the agents to submit inspection report while working offline onsite.
          outcome: |
            We built the app in 3 parts, the API sits on the database, acts as the middleman for the mobile app and the website.
            The mobile app sync assigned entities to the device everytime the user login, then function normally in offline
            mode.

            The project was released and used internally by the company.

            periodically push update signals to a centralized data service. The app the watch for the changes and do 
            aggregation on the data to provide updates.
          outcome: |
            We setup the data service to be a minimal API which does nothing but receiving incoming requests and push the
            payload to the database. On each successful operation, a signal is emmitted via RabbitMQ.

            The app listen to the signals then either response to emergency messages or pool them to do aggregation later.

            The frontend component (built in Vuejs) is only for displaying the calculated values in real time.

            The app wasn't completed yet when I left the project.

            A few apps in the ERP require access to the current work items in TFS but the API they provided is kinda slow
            and direct DB connection is impractical. This app is born to build a in-house cache of recent work items.
          outcome: |
            I designed the solution. It has a windows service that periodically fetch the updated work items from TFS, then
            send update signals to RabbitMQ to queue an update.
            The app was released and used internally.

            The app is an immitation of Slack. It provides an interactive environments for product owners to test and
            give feedback for the apps developed. The development teams were notified of the feedback based on their 
            preferences and involvement.
          outcome: |
            I designed the app to have a standalone WebAPI that can be invoked by any apps in the ERP via the internally
            published nuget package. That way, any users/apps can create discussions and post comments based on context
            generated by their apps.

            Since nobody can force anyone to upgrade their dependency nuget packages, the WebAPI has multiple versions
            with backward compatibility to support the apps that rarely get updated.

            The app was released internally and was used in various contexts.

            The app is an address book. It shows data about the company's employees, such as contact, department,
            current projects they're working on and even salary packages.
            The previous version of the app was developed with ASP .Net MVC 5, the new version was developed with
            React and ASP .Net backend.
          outcome:
            I rebuilt the UI as a single page application, separating the backend concern out of the front end codebase.
            Some data provided by other ERP apps (like salary packages) were fetched via AJAX from the front end
            instead of direct database access. This is a design choice, to prepare the app for the eventual micro services
            migration.

            The app provided ERP applications catalouge, quick access to applications' overview together
            with development and deployment status.
            The previous version of the app was developed with ASP .Net MVC 5, the new version was developed with
            React and ASP .Net backend.
          outcome: |
            I architected the project and presented it to the director. The finalized plan was simplified
            in a few areas, since the ecosystem was not ready for Micro Services just yet.

            I designed and develop both the front end and back end of the project. Most of the legacy components
            can't be reused since it's a different architecture and the previous implementation hadn't followed
            MVC guidelines properly.

            Some expensive operations (such as calculating project's progress) are scheduled using RabbitMQ. The
            front end (React) then pull the operation status periodically to update the UI.

            The product was released and launched internally, replaced the previous version.

            The app provided functionalities to network-wide softwares installation and tracking. The
            admin could monitor the installed softwares on all POS machines and keep them up to date.
          outcome: |
            I worked on rebuilding a few features with ASP .Net MVC 5, since the super app was built
            with the first generation ASP. I thought upgrading to MVC provided limited benefits since
            the underlying infrastructres were still stuck in stone age. But that was the job.

            had provided rapid access to historical medical scanning images, patients 
            medical history and doctor to doctor collaboration.
          outcome: |
            I worked on a few different areas of the app, but the most interesting is
            the scans viewer. It connected to a few data endpoints, fetch & cache the relevant images,

            The game was about illegal street racers. The game let the players select 
            a wide range of sponsored cars to enter various races to earn more fake cash.

            The players then can spend those cash to satisfy their vanity and narcicism by
            doing paint jobs, engine modifications and get BIGGER cars.
          outcome: |
            I worked on handling the hardware interruption when the user pressed
            the home button, or switch the app to inactive state. When that happen
            the game must release all graphic resources and recreate them from cache
            the next time the game became active.
