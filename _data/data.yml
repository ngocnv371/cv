            Develop an application to assist the physicians in their medical practices.
            The app was developed using Sencha Touch (a JavaScript framework). The app
            had provided rapid access to historical medical scanning images, patients 
            medical history and doctor to doctor collaboration.
          outcome: | 
            I worked on a few different areas of the app, but the most interesting is
            the scans viewer. It connected to a few data endpoints, fetch & cache the relevant images,
            a few items ech time and show it to the users.
            The application has been released and available world-wide.
          toolset: 
            - Sencha Touch
            - JavaScript

            Port the game which was developed in C++ & Flash for iOS platform to Android.
            The game was about an immortal yellow banana monster which run around
            and wreak havoc around the world.
          outcome: | 
            Much similar to the previous project, I worked on handling the system events.
            The game is available world-wide in Play Store.

            Port the game which was developed in C++ & Flash for iOS platform to Android.
            The game was about illegal street racers. The game let the players select 
            a wide range of sponsored cars to enter various races to earn more fake cash.
            The players then can spend those cash to satisfy their vanity and narcicism by
            doing paint jobs, engine modifications and get BIGGER cars.
          outcome: | 
            I worked on handling the hardware interruption when the user pressed
            the home button, or switch the app to inactive state. When that happen
            the game must release all graphic resources and recreate them from cache
            the next time the game became active.
            The game is available world-wide in Play Store.
